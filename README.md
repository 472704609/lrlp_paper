==========

Like the OMRP paper, I have set this up so that each sentence is on its own line.  This way Git will keep track of how sentences in the paper change over time, rather than keeping track of paragraphs.

Unlike the OMRP paper, this repository has two branches:

* *master* Most changes should be made on master.
* *iserc* Changes specific to the ISERC paper should be made here.
    Whenever we need to update the ISERC paper, I will merge the changes from master into this branch
