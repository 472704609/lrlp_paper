==========

Like the OMRP paper, I have set this up so that each sentence is on its own line.  This way Git will keep track of how sentences in the paper change over time, rather than keeping track of paragraphs.

Unlike the OMRP paper, this repository has two branches:

* *master* Most changes should be made on master.
* *water_sustainability_report* contains the much abbreviated paper for the WSP fellowship.
    This paper is required to have a title page, have 4-6 pages of text in the format that I have changed it to, and to include any figures in additional pages at the end.  I have put the figures in an appendix.
* *winter_simulation_proceedings* to make the WSC proceedings paper.
* *iserc* Changes specific to the ISERC paper should be made here.
